### VPN & Anonymity Misuse
Using a VPN, proxy, or any anonymizing service **does not exempt** you from the terms of this license. All usage, regardless of network masking, is subject to the same legal and technical standards outlined in this agreement. Attempts to exploit anonymity to violate licensing terms, redistribute Nexus illegally, or impersonate developers/users will still be investigated and may result in a permanent ban, project-level restrictions, or legal action. We reserve the right to track and log behavior patterns that indicate misuse, even when basic user information is obfuscated. VPNs are tools for privacy not immunity from responsibility. Our demo version of **Nexus** currently _does not_ support VPNs all VPN usage shall be blocked for this demo version for responsibility reasons.

## Use of the Name "Nexus"
The name **Nexus** is a registered trademark of **Nexus.inc** and is protected under intellectual property laws.

It is important to clarify that Nexus Browser is an original creation, developed independently and without influence from any existing projects, including but not limited to any project with a similar name such as the “NewSysBrowser” or any other browser project that might be mistakenly associated with the Nexus name. Any claims that Nexus Browser is a copy or derivative of these projects are unfounded and do not reflect the truth of its development history. This statement serves to protect both the integrity of Nexus Browser and the legal rights of Nexus.inc.
