# Nexus Browser Demo
Nexus is a gaming browser designed to give you full control over your system’s internet, CPU, and RAM usage, ensuring smooth gameplay. Enjoy animated backgrounds, background music, and organize tabs into Workspaces to group and open multiple tabs at once. Add mods to customize your browser exactly how you want.

We encourage users to explore, test, and provide feedback to help us improve Nexus before its official release.
