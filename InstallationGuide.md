# Installation Guide

To install the Nexus browser demo on your device, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Visit the [Download](./download.md) Page**  
   Head over to the official Nexus repository and navigate to the **Releases** section. Download the latest available **demo build**—the file will typically be in `.exe` format for Windows systems.

2. **Run the Installer**  
   Once the file has finished downloading, double-click the installer to begin the setup process. Follow the on-screen instructions and prompts. You may be asked to agree to terms, select an installation location, and choose whether or not to create a desktop shortcut.

3. **Launch the Browser**  
   After installation is complete, you can launch Nexus either from the **Start Menu**, your **desktop shortcut**, or by searching "Nexus" from the system’s search bar.

4. **Explore the Demo Version**  
   This version includes early features and may still contain bugs. Test out all the features available—such as tabbed browsing, bookmarks, and the customizable settings panel—and experience what the future of Nexus holds.

5. **Report Any Issues**  
   If you encounter bugs or unexpected behavior, please report them via the **Issues** section in this repository. Your feedback is extremely valuable and helps us improve the final product before the stable release.

> ⚠ **This is an early demo version and may not reflect the full capabilities of the final browser.**
