## macOS Installation Guide

To install the Nexus browser demo on macOS, follow the steps below:

1. **Download the Latest Demo Build**  
   Go to the official [Releases](./Releases) section of this repository and download the latest `.dmg` or `.zip` build of Nexus made for macOS systems.

2. **Open the Installer File**  
   Once the download finishes, locate the `.dmg` or extracted `.app` file in your **Downloads** folder. If it’s a `.zip`, simply double-click to extract it. If it’s a `.dmg`, double-click to mount it.

3. **Drag Nexus to Applications**  
   In the window that opens, **drag the Nexus app into your `Applications` folder**. This ensures it's installed system-wide and can be launched easily.

4. **Launch Nexus Browser**  
   Open **Launchpad** or navigate to the **Applications** folder and open **Nexus**. The first time you open it, macOS may show a warning saying the app is from an unidentified developer—click **Open** from the prompt or allow it in **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**.

5. **Test the Features**  
   Once launched, try out everything available in the demo: tab browsing, bookmarks, settings, and anything else included in this version.

6. **Report Bugs or Feedback**  
   If you spot any issues or quirks, head to the **Issues** tab in this repository and let us know. We want your feedback to make the full release as stable and smooth as possible.
